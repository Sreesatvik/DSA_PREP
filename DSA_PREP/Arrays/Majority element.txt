Given an array nums of size n, return the majority element.

The majority element is the element that appears more than ⌊n / 2⌋ times. You may assume that the majority element always exists in the array.

LOGIC=
Initialize 2 variables:
Count –  for tracking the count of element
Element – for which element we are counting
Traverse through the given array.
If Count is 0 then store the current element of the array as Element.
If the current element and Element are the same increase the Count by 1.
If they are different decrease the Count by 1.
The integer present in Element should be the result we are expecting

Code:
int majorityElement(vector<int>& nums) {
        int n = nums.size();
        int ele,count=0;
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
            if(count==0){
                count=1;
                ele=nums[i];
            }
            else if(ele==nums[i]){
                count++;
            }
            else{
                count--;
            }
        }
        return ele;
    }
